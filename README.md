A repo for sharing our Spinnaker Summit 2019 decks, since all the online slide share apps compress the decks and make them look bad.

## (Spinnaker Summit 2019) Get in the Game: How to Use Referee and Kayenta to Do Canary Analysis

Do you want to conduct canary analysis for services that are not yet using Spinnaker? Are your services split between Spinnaker and legacy deployment processes, but you still want to canary? Come to this session and learn about standalone canary analysis with Kayenta, Spinnaker's canary engine. We will discuss how we at Nike collaborated with the Spinnaker community, contributed to Kayenta, and developed Referee, an open source user interface, to enable canary in our non-Spinnaker deployment process.
